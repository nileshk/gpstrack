# gps-track
GPS tracking iOS client and server [inactive project]

iOS client sends location information to a server (Java).  Originally started (in 2015) 
with the intention of creating a location-based game with a focus on fitness.  Development
of that stalled, but this is a generic starting point for a location-based app.

Technologies used:
* Swift
* Java 8
* Spring Boot
* Postgres / PostGIS
